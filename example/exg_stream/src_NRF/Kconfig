config STATE_MACHINE_USE_CPU_IDLE
	bool "Use k_cpu_idle() instead of k_sleep() in state machine loop"
	default n
	help
	  If enabled, the state machine thread will use k_cpu_idle() instead of
	  k_sleep(K_USEC(1)) between state run() iterations. k_cpu_idle() keeps
	  the CPU more responsive but may consume more power. k_sleep() yields
	  CPU time to other threads more effectively and reduces power consumption.

config ADS_USE_BIPOLAR_MODE
	bool "Use bipolar mode for ADS (ExG shield)"
	default n
	help
	  If enabled, the ADS (Analog-to-Digital Sensor) will be powered on in
	  bipolar mode when entering the S_NORDIC_STREAM state. If disabled,
	  unipolar mode is used. The choice depends on the ExG shield hardware
	  configuration and the type of biopotential signals being measured.
	  
	  - Bipolar mode (EMG): Differential measurement between two electrodes
	  - Unipolar mode (EEG): Single-ended measurement referenced to ground
