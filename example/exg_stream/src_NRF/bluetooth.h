/**
 * @file bluetooth.h
 * @brief Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Communication Interface
 *
 * This module provides high-level BLE functionality for the SENSEI platform:
 * - BLE advertising and connection management
 * - Data transmission via Nordic UART Service (NUS)
 * - Packet statistics for debugging and performance analysis
 * - Connection diagnostics and throughput measurement
 *
 * @section ble_usage Usage Example
 * @code
 * // During system initialization
 * start_bluetooth_adverts();
 *
 * // Wait for connection, then start streaming
 * ble_reset_packet_counters();
 *
 * // During streaming - send sensor data
 * send_data_ble(packet_data, packet_length);
 *
 * // After streaming - check statistics
 * ble_print_packet_stats();
 *
 * // Or get stats programmatically
 * ble_packet_stats_t stats;
 * ble_get_packet_stats(&stats);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section ble_packet_format Packet Format Detection
 * The module automatically detects packet types based on header bytes:
 * - 0x55: EEG/ExG data packets (192 bytes, without IMU)
 * - 0x56: IMU accelerometer packets (127 bytes, independent 400 Hz stream)
 * - 0xAA: Microphone audio packets (131 bytes)
 *
 * @section ble_debugging Debugging Packet Loss
 * To debug packet loss between firmware and Python receiver:
 * 1. Call ble_reset_packet_counters() before starting streaming
 * 2. Stream data for a known duration
 * 3. Call ble_print_packet_stats() after stopping
 * 4. Compare firmware counts with Python receiver counts
